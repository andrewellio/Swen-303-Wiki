21 years old, John is a student at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW). He is in his 3rd year, studying towards a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours, majoring in Software Engineering. John likes to be proactive in his learning and understands course content by asking questions in lectures. John will be able to use the SQS for the time when he is not in lectures. At the end of each trimester, near examinations, John likes to study by practising past exam papers. John often finds getting answers and supporting feedback for these questions difficult and would much rather studying using an easier method, like an SQS. John prioritises studying his unfamiliar topics and likes to discuss these with his friends to get a better understanding.

**Activities:** John likes to make time for study at home but also to hang out with friends in the weekends. John also likes to remain active on online help forums, to share his knowledge with others about course related topics.

**Attitudes:** John has a positive attitude towards any work that he undertakes, both at university and for his part-time job as a fast-food employee. 
Aptitudes: He is an enthusiastic and energetic individual. John is also keen to try new things.

**Weaknesses:** John finds interpreting feedback a challenge and therefore is also unsure where he is at, in terms of what course sections to study for.

**Domain Knowledge:** John has used forums similar to an SQS, as well as an SQS for a course he had taken last year, but found it confusing to use.

**System Knowledge:** John knows the basics of what an SQS system contains, and the typical question format. A question, answer and explanation.

**Interaction:** John will interact with the SQS whenever he has questions or has answers about assignments and courses. He will use this system at university and at home.

**Priorities:** John wants to be able to post questions and get answers within a reasonable period. He also wants to be able to share his answers to questions others are asking. Finally, he expects that the SQS system will collect material that will be able to be used for student self-testing.

**Motivations:** John generally likes asking questions and getting to know answers. He will use the SQS to further increase his learning in courses. He hopes to continue to achieve in his courses with a sense of clarity and graduate in his final year.

**Computer self-efficacy:** John can navigate around an SQS with reasonable ease (provided the system design has had some input from students). He does prefer to ask questions in person but is happy to also engage in an SQS implemented online (preferably with support from VUW).

**Risk tolerance:** John has a moderate risk tolerance â€“ he finds no risk in using systems that are supported by VUW but does hesitate with using external systems that are not supported and he might not know much about.

**Information Processing:** John writes down all the questions he has, and asks these, with also writing down the answers to them. He then reads his list of questions and makes sure that he understands the answers.

**Tinkering:** John is keen to try any system that might help benefit his learning, especially if it gives him a new tool to experiment studying with.

I have chosen John as the most important persona because he is keen to experiment with an SQS, supported by VUW. This means a continuous engagement in the design process and an appreciation for the system tasks and use cases.
