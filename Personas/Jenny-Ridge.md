20 years old, Jenny is a student at Victoria University of Wellington. She is in her 2nd year, studying towards a Bachelor of Laws. Jenny has a creativity and competitive spirit and she tries her best to show this while studying. An SQS will appear as a useful tool for Jenny when study period arrives, as well as throughout the year for general course questions. Jenny doesn’t enjoy studying for exams, more specifically because she needs to memorise large bits of content in her textbook. In addition, Jenny struggles to explain why the solution she has chosen, is a good one for a law scenario. Jenny likes to discuss different solutions with her friends and would also benefit from sharing her solutions through an online SQS.

**Activities:** Jenny tends to only study when she needs to, often in the study period before exams. She tries to study with creativity in mind, for example creating flashcards. Jenny likes to meet with her friends from time to time, but prefers to study by herself.

**Attitudes:** Jenny has a nervous attitude towards any project or work. She wants to do well but is often unsure if she is meeting the requirements. 
Aptitudes: Jenny has a good work ethic and tries to stay on task to the best of her ability.

**Weaknesses:** Jenny finds it hard to do new things and is comfortable with her methods in studying that she has already developed. 

**Domain Knowledge:** Jenny hasn’t had much experience using an SQS system before and is moderately interested in the idea.

**System Knowledge:** Jenny is unsure of the operations of an SQS but does know that it has a good level of student involvement.

**Interaction:** Jenny will use the SQS as an alternative to using textbooks. She will also use it as a way of receiving helpful feedback and how she answered the question compared to others.

**Priorities:** Jenny wants a way to study that is non-repetitive and boring. She also wants to be able to use her competitive and creative personality in her studies. Jenny believes that the SQS will be for the students, to motivate them and help them answer their questions.

**Motivations:** Jenny is motivated by exciting things that involve being able to use her creative personality. An SQS is an option to motivate Jenny and others in an interactive environment.

**Computer self-efficacy:** Jenny is confident with using many online systems, and usually prefers this over real text-based reading and writing. She is keen for an online implementation of an SQS, but also wants some authentication for her own account.

**Risk tolerance:** Jenny does find it hard to take risks sometimes, since she isn’t usually comfortable in trying new things. If an SQS system appears to help others, she might give it a go.

**Information Processing:** Jenny tries questions in text books and then compares the answer. The questions she got wrong, keeps note of them and forms explanations why her answer was incorrect. Jenny could benefit from an SQS by practising writing some explanations to unanswered questions.

**Tinkering:** Jenny likes to improve her skills in tools that she is used to using. Also, her interest in art, influences her studies by making colourful notes.

I have chosen Jenny as the second most important persona. Even though she is mildly interested in an SQS system, there is a good level of creativity and interaction that she will be able to take part in. In addition the SQS should be appealing to students to motivate them in their studies.
