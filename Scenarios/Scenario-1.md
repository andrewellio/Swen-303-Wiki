I have chosen John for Scenario 1 because his persona describes how he likes to ask a lot of questions. Seeing how John will use an SQS will be beneficial in the design process for what John should expect and be able to do. On the other hand, how the system should interact to provide the appropriate interfaces to create a question. John is fully committed to an introduction of an SQS, and his priority is question generation, thus he is listed as Scenario 1.
