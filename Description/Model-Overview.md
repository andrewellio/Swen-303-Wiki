I am limited to the amount of resources and time I have for persona creation, so I decided to simulate the process for persona creation. I have done this by taking some reviews from the existing systems (mainly peerwise) that I have identified above and including useful features by students and lecturers. Students will be the primary users of this system as it is an SQS. I should consider the possibility of the SQS being integrated into other Universities, to also be considered in the model.

I will call this technique ‘competitor analysis’.
This will generate fictional persona’s which will have goals, as well as expectations from what they want (and more). This will then be reflected in favor for an SQS, as a solution.
In the persona creation process I will choose persona’s that share similar views, goals and expectations in order to consider and focus on the relevant aspects. These aspects will help with the design process as well as experiencing empathy and all three artifacts (making, communicating and validating).

PeerWise – Review for what students and university staff think: Aspects as persona’s:

Conclusions and similarities for views:
* Easy, accessible and readily available (relates to the first business objective)
* Interactivity and sociality while studying
* Creativity to challenge and motivate students
* Useful and helpful feedback when wanted 
* Explanations in student words and step by step solutions to answer questions

As most university students shared the same views, I will use them as my personas. I will choose John and Jenny as my two main personas as they had the most relations to the views above. I have decided not to include the lecturer persona as the SQS is for the students. This should be referred back to, if a moderator/admin system is to be introduced/desired in the design.
I created the ‘use case diagram’ by thinking about the uses that a typical university student would likely want from an SQS. This helped me to create some main tasks. I created the tasks, based on the ‘function/use’ that they are likely to do, not based on the technicality details. 
I created tasks by comparing to other existing systems, and found their useful/common features:
