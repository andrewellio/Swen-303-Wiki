I am limited to the amount of resources and time I have for persona creation, so I decided to simulate the process for persona creation. I have done this by taking some reviews from the existing systems (mainly peerwise) that I have identified above and including useful features by students and lecturers. Students will be the primary users of this system as it is an SQS. I should consider the possibility of the SQS being integrated into other Universities, to also be considered in the model.

I will call this technique ‘competitor analysis’.
This will generate fictional persona’s which will have goals, as well as expectations from what they want (and more). This will then be reflected in favor for an SQS, as a solution.
In the persona creation process I will choose persona’s that share similar views, goals and expectations in order to consider and focus on the relevant aspects. These aspects will help with the design process as well as experiencing empathy and all three artifacts (making, communicating and validating).
