Users, particularly students should be aware of questioning systems that are available for them to use when preparing for tests and exams.  Students should access the questioning system as an entity and be grouped into similar courses. Within these groups, students need to have the ability to be able to ask, answer and explain questions in the questioning system. This should be presented to the student in a user-friendly interface design as well as being robust and efficient. 
The SQS should adhere to these three business objectives:

1.	Able to be reliably accessed before the period for major tests and exams
2.	Support functionality of creating questions and answers, and a self-testing ability
3.	Navigation and relevant material to the user is displayed and viewable on the interface
