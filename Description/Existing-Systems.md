**Peerwise** lets users create and answer questions about courses they are enrolled in. It features a basic main menu, which looks outdated and could be improved with some new modern interface elements. I like how with each question it has a score rating. The rating is based on the quality and accuracy, which is a key feature, useful for effective learning. https://peerwise.cs.auckland.ac.nz/docs/students/

**Quizlet** provides learning tools and flashcards for self-learning and can be shared with others. I like how it features multiple methods of learning that helps users with memorization, testing and explaining. The Quizlet website has a good modern design and can be viewed on the web or through a smartphone.

**Kahoot** is an interactive focused questioning system. It allows users to write a set of questions and tests users in an interactive quiz with multiple choice answers. Users can open a ‘play session’ which displays the questions and answers on one screen. Each user ‘playing’ can submit their answer on their own device by selecting the corresponding color/shape. I am impressed by the simplicity and design of the ‘play sessions’, it is both simple and functional.

**ECS Forums** is designed for users enrolled in ECS courses at Victoria University of Wellington. Users can ask questions in a forum post, which starts a thread. Others (users, moderators, tutors and lecturer’s) can see new thread’s that have been created and can contribute with their replies (answers). I think the forum could be improved by introducing more sections. For example, a section just for Q&A’s rather than having lots of different topics under the ‘board topics.’
