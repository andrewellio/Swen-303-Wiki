## Peerwise Designed Pages for Website

DELETE THIS BELOW

This is where you describe each page and give a design image. Each page should have which persona/personas will use the page. You could specify a primary and secondary if that is relevant for your design. This could also link to the scenarios or tasks that you have included.

You should explain the design features of your image at the start of each image. This makes it clear what you were trying to achieve. If you set up each task as an issue you could refer to the issue number like above, or you can name the task it refers to. This is the main page for the LMS, as it is the landing page after login. You will note the large course buttons, the calendar to show upcoming events, the timeline along the bottom with assignments shown as coloured marks and the top menu. The "hover event" showing the assignment details is shown at the bottom.
