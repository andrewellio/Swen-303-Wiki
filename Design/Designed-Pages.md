## Peerwise Designed Pages for Website

**Common across all pages:**

The separators help to separate elements into groups to be able to be readable and presented. The help button will feature a hover over question mark cursor, displaying help for the main buttons/actions.

### Peerwise Home Page

Persona/s: [Jenny Ridge](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Personas/Jenny-Ridge)

I have chosen Jenny as the persona for the Peerwise homepage. Jenny will want to see what Peerwise is all about as she is cautious about using an SQS. The section 'hear want students to have to say' will particularly appeal to Jenny and will hopefully encourage her to try out the SQS.

This page is the default page that all new visitors (students) will arrive too. Students who have already logged in (and are remembered) will not see this page unless they log out. This page features a slide show for what Peerwise is, giving students the option to find out more if they are interested. Four short icons and text summarises Peerwise's values and tells students what features that can expect from Peerwise's SQS. Previous experiences will encourage and convince students that Peerwise is a valuable tool. Several other facts and graphs will also support this. The design convention by most websites has the 'sign up and login' button at the top right, whereas information buttons are next to the slideshow.

### Signup and Login Page

Persona/s: [John Allgear](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Personas/John-Allgear)

I have chosen John as the persona for the Signup and Login page. John is likely to signup as soon as he is able to. He should expect the process to be quick and intuitive. He will want to see options for both sign up and login (as this is what the button he clicked said). John will likely use Peerwise frequently and will find the remember me option helpful to bypass this page.

By clicking the login/sign up button on the home page, redirects to the signup and login page (indicates that students are interested to use Peerwise.) The page is designed around details for university students. The page intuitively lets the student know to first select their university and then either fill in the signup or login form. The signup form features a tick or cross for when the entry needs to be valid. Simple buttons will offer an optional newsletter and a required agreement. Icons support button texts to make the action that the button will perform as clear as possible. 

(Note: slight mistake on Student ID alignment, sorry!)    

### Student Home Page

Persona/s: [John Allgear](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Personas/John-Allgear)

I have chosen John as the persona for the Student Home as he will see this page every time he loads the Peerwise website (provided he has used the remember me option). He will use this page to create questions and view statistics about his questions asked. John will be expected to be returned to this page every time he has finished working on a question.

By completing the signup and/or logging in, there is redirection to the Student Home Page (the central landing page and dashboard for the student.) The page has several new elements available now that a student is logged in, such as the navigation bar in the top ribbon and the account status in the top right-hand corner (verification that student has logged in successfully). These elements are consistent across all pages unless they signout (brought back to homepage or signup/login in page). This page aims to feature the most important elements for a student being; List of assigned courses, student actions, and student stats. Other elements accompany the page; recently created questions and Peerwise news. Large shapes, buttons, and text help to highlight the fact that students can start an activity. Student actions also feature the uses cases for scenarios 1, 2, and 3. 

### Create A Question (3 pages)

Persona/s: [John Allgear](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Personas/John-Allgear)

Page features [Scenario 1](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Scenarios/Scenario-1)

I have chosen John as the persona for creating a question, as this is the most likely and common feature that John will use the Peerwise SQS for. He is also expected to use this page as described per Scenario 1.

![Create_A_Question__1st_Prompt_-Known_Answer_](uploads/b9b91dc1979752307f07d123f1c09d50/Create_A_Question__1st_Prompt_-Known_Answer_.png)

![Create_A_Question__2nd_Prompt_-_Choose_question_to_answer_](uploads/b80a43e213658d28265ad8803e5c1e18/Create_A_Question__2nd_Prompt_-_Choose_question_to_answer_.png)

![Create_A_Question](uploads/12bf5a2aff1b4a1b4ef9b6e7cde7e635/Create_A_Question.png)

By clicking on the create a question button, there is redirection to the Create a Question page. Before the template can be accessed, two question requirements need to be asked. These are displayed by prompt boxes. These questions aim to ask for the contextual answer to the question rather than a simple yes or no question. Once the template page appears only the left side panel is visible. The left panel features the text boxes required to fill in and may be limited depending on if the question has a known answer or not. This can be changed if needed in the question properties box. The question answeres feature a built-in switch to identify the correct and incorrect answer/s. Once all required text fields are filled in, the Publish question button changes from greyed out to available. This button can be pressed and the question preview box starts loading as well as several progress information icons. 

### Answer (3 pages)

Persona/s: [Jenny Ridge](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Personas/Jenny-Ridge)

Page features [Scenario 2](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Scenarios/Scenario-2)

I have chosen Jenny as the persona for answering a question, as Jenny usually likes to share solutions and can use Peerwise's SQS to do this. She is also expected to use this page as described per Scenario 2.
