## Peerwise Designed Pages for Website

**Common across all pages:**

The separators help to separate elements into groups to be able to be readable and presented. The help button will feature a hover over question mark cursor, displaying help for the main buttons/actions.

### Peerwise Home Page

Persona/s: [Jenny Ridge](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Personas/Jenny-Ridge)

I have chosen Jenny as the persona for the Peerwise homepage. Jenny will want to see what Peerwise is all about as she is cautious about using an SQS. The section 'hear want students to have to say' will particularly appeal to Jenny and will hopefully encourage her to try out the SQS.

This page is the default page that all new visitors (students) will arrive too. Students who have already logged in (and are remembered) will not see this page unless they log out. This page features a slide show for what Peerwise is, giving students the option to find out more if they are interested. Four short icons and text summarises Peerwise's values and tells students what features that can expect from Peerwise's SQS. Previous experiences will encourage and convince students that Peerwise is a valuable tool. Several other facts and graphs will also support this. The design convention by most websites has the 'sign up and login' button at the top right, whereas information buttons are next to the slideshow.

### Signup and Login Page

Persona/s: [John Allgear](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Personas/John-Allgear)

I have chosen John as the persona for the Signup and Login page. John is likely to signup as soon as he is able to. He should expect the process to be quick and intuitive. He will want to see options for both sign up and login (as this is what the button he clicked said). John will likely use Peerwise frequently and will find the remember me option helpful to bypass this page.

By clicking the login/sign up button on the home page, redirects to the signup and login page (indicates that students are interested to use Peerwise.) The page is designed around details for university students. The page intuitively lets the student know to first select their university and then either fill in the signup or login form. The signup form features a tick or cross for when the entry needs to be valid. Simple buttons will offer an optional newsletter and a required agreement. Icons support button texts to make the action that the button will perform as clear as possible. 

(Note: slight mistake on Student ID alignment, sorry!)
