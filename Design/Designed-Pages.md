### Peerwise Homepage

Persona/s: [Jenny Ridge](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Personas/Jenny-Ridge)

I have chosen Jenny as the persona for the Peerwise homepage. Jenny will want to see what Peerwise is all about as she is cautious about using an SQS. The section 'hear want students to have to say' will particularly appeal to Jenny and will hopefully encourage her to try out the SQS.

This page is the default page that all new visitors (students) will arrive too. Students who have already logged in (and are remembered) will not see this page unless they log out. This page features a slide show for what Peerwise is, giving students the option to find out more if they are interested. Four short icons and text summarises Peerwise's values and tells students what features that can expect from Peerwise's SQS. Previous experiences will encourage and convince students that Peerwise is a valuable tool. Several other facts and graphs will also support this. The design convention by most websites has the 'sign up and login' button at the top right, whereas information buttons are next to the slideshow.
