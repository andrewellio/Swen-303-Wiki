Peerwise is a SQS and was developed by the University of Auckland. It has now been used by most Universities in New Zealand and in other countries. 

The concept and idea of an SQS, such as Peerwise, aims to achieve a simple and intuitive interface for students. 

The current state of Peerwise is functional, simple/basic but lacks an intuitive design and is outdated. [Similar systems](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Description/Existing-Systems) have a more modern interface and is thus more appealing to the newer generation of students. Students are generally more active on the internet than previous generations and will expect a 'certain level' of appearance, color scheme, and layout which is simple, usable, and functional. I will attempt to re-design Peerwise's interface so it achieves a good expected level of design by today's standards.

Main features to improve on are:
*  Reduce the amount of text explanation (incorporate in a help section/hover over help)
*  Navigation Bar (default way to get to a certain section of the website)
*  Intuitive clickable icons/text (buttons that can be clicked)
*  General interface update according to the main identifiable [tasks/scenarios](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/andrewelli/swen-303/-/wikis/Description/Use-Case-Diagram).

I will be re-designing the Peerwise website for laptop/desktops, suited for a web version. I believe this is the best approach design-wise and may encourage future development for an app version.

In terms of layout, the website will conform to at least a 16:9 ration with a 1366x768 resolution (minimum).
