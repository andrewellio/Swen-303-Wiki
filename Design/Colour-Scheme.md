I have generated a color palette similar to the existing blue scheme on the current website. The pages for Peerwise will primarily be 'Carolina blue' (5398BE) and 'Indigo dye' (134074). The other colors will be used as complementary colors to the existing two colors chosen.

(Note: Unfortunately I am unable to run Adobe XD on my computer as it is quite old, so I tried to represent this on Balsamiq. Obviously, due to some color limitations on some of the components, I wasn't able to quite get the whole page how I wanted it but it was reasonably close.)

The colors mostly fit together, however, I couldn't find a good color for the buttons, so I decided to choose one of the default blue colors from the color picker.

Generally, the color scheme is quite an important feature in terms of design, but for this Assignment, I decided to focus more on the layout of each page rather than the color.
