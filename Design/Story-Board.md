The general flow of these pages are through the clicking of buttons.

Flow 1 (Blue) is the initial login phase. A student will need to register first and then login. This is the process that every student will take to log in to Peerwise. This will usually be a one time process, dependent upon if the remember me option is enabled. Once the login button is clicked the student home page is loaded.

Flow 2 (Green) is the creation of a question phase. A student who wishes to create a question will click this button and be asked two question requirements. They are then able to write the question in the template and then publish the question. After the publishing process is complete, they will be redirected to the student home.

Flow 3 (Pink) is the creation of an answer to a question phase. A student who wishes to answer a question will click this button and be asked two question answer requirements. They are then able to write the answer to the question in the template and then publish the answered question. After the publishing process is complete, they will be redirected to the student home.

Flow 4 (Orange) is the testing phase. A student who wishes to test him/herself will click this button and be asked one test requirement. They are then able to start the quiz. The student can stop the quiz at any time. Once the student has either stopped or finished the quiz, they will be redirected to the test results page. The student can then resume the test (if they stopped it) or see past test results. They will click the Student Home in the navigation bar to return to the student home.

Flow 5 (Grey) is the viewing option for questions. A student who wishes to view the lists of questions will click this button. The lists can be filtered in three ways...ratings answered or unanswered questions.
